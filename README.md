*LINK IS DEAD*

**message from bd: hhh-swart has been taken down! the remaining urls still work (hhh-swart-azure.vercel.app, hhh-swart-test.vercel.app) but we can't edit the site. i personally think that maybe nebula did something when they rebooted the project that removed all the forks, or maybe they singled us out personally (which 3kh0 has done in the past). whatever the case, im maybe gonna try to start a new service (with meta if he feels like it) that isn't a fork of something else. let's see how it goes!**
